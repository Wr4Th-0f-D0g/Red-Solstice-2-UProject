# Red Solstice 2 uproject

mod sdk for the game Red Solstice 2: Survivors
This is incomplete due to limitations in technology and patience, but should still be pretty useable.
Thanks to Buckminsterfullerene and others in the Unreal Engine modding community for the tools and help to even get this far.

To use: download Unreal Engine 4.27 from the Epic Games Launcher then right click on the .uproject and generate visual studio project files.
Open the .sln, build, drop the Content folder in the project directory, then open the .uproject. Happy Modding!
